# How to Use
You can run the application by having Python 3 installed and running the main.py in your terminal,
this will open up a window with several button that allow you to interact with the db as well as a table to display information
## Add/Delete Items
Clicking on the add/delete item buttons will open a new smaller window where you can select what kind of item you would like,
dependent on what you chose you will be promted with the required information, the ID will be auto generated by the table when creating new items.
Once you confirm your inputs a confirmation or error message will appear and you will be able to fix your inputs or continue with new ones

## Checking Out/Returning Books
Checking out and returning books act quite similar to the adding and deleting of other items, but we though as a library books are the main focus and deserve their own buttons

## Displaying the List of Checked Out Books
If you click on the "checked out list" button, a table will appear displaying the information for all the books that are currently checked out

## Searcing for a Member
The search member button will open a new window that will promt you for a memberID, once entered their name, address, birthday, what books they've checked out, and any unpaid fines

After searching the edit button will also be clickable, this allows the user to edit the name, address, and birthday of the current member, this button also blocks you from searching a new member until the now clickable save or cancel buttons are clicked, clicking save will update the member infor in the database

## Searching for a Book
Works the same was as the search member function

## Browsing books
This button will display a table of all the books and their relevant information in the window, you can then narrow your search by genre
